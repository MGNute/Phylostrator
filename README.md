# The Phylostrator
A library and GUI for drawing and annotation large phylogenies, with a python application layer that can be used for scripting. 

Do you want to generate many images of large phylogenies? Do you want to provide your own external annotation of nodes on the phylogeny? Do you want a loosely cobbled together hodge-podge of subroutines to draw your own pictures of alignments and trees, with a cryptic and bug-filled GUI just in case? Then you have come to the right place.
