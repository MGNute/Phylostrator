# The Phylostrator
A library and GUI for drawing and annotation large phylogenies, with a python application layer that can be used for scripting. 

This is a development version and contains many incomplete functions and has no guarantee that it will work. It's currently in the process of moving from displaying graphics based on the Wx drawing routines to the cairo graphics library, and that is not fully complete. Please contact me with any questions (nute2@illinois.edu).
